# hastings

- Issues identified with the data and how these were addressed
- Data cleansing
* Data cleaning - dodgy characters stripped
* Some features constant - dropped
* Incomplete coverage of features and inconsistent distribution - marked those as recent coverage only
* Latest weather not reliable - did not fix but could have used external data joined on date


- Model specification and justification for selecting this model specification
- Assessment of your model's accuracy and model diagnostics
- Suggestions of how your model could be improved
* Bayesian causal approach
* 
- Practical challenges for implementing your model
* Lots of grouped count variables - tried adding mean target encoding to summarise
